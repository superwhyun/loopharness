description: Review current changes in this repository using the canonical review workflow.

Read these files first:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/REVIEW.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/ADR.md`

Then inspect the current diff and produce a findings-first review.

Target project resolution:

1. Use a project path appended by the user when present.
2. Otherwise read `.harness/current_project`.
3. If neither exists or the value is empty, ask the user for the target project path.

Rules:

1. Focus on bugs, regressions, risky assumptions, and missing verification.
2. Point to concrete files and locations when possible.
3. If no issues are found, state that explicitly.
4. Keep the review aligned with the current phase/step.

If the user appended extra instructions after `/skill:review`, apply them as additional review scope.
